    PEP: 007
    Title: Business REST CRUD
    Author: Xi√°n BOULLOSA <xianbtrigo@gmail.com>
    Status: draft  

# Abstract

The goal of this PEP is to propose a default REST resource implementation that would expose any marked DTO as a REST CRUD resource. 
This resource would support hypermedia and pagination.

# Motivation

We want to speed-up the development of business code with SeedStack. Although we don't want to reduce REST API design to 
simple CRUD operations, it is nonetheless a big part of the development work. This proposal would significantly reduce this work
for the developer.
